rest-example
============

Investigation into using [Apache Camel][1] to host a web service and [backbone.js][2] to access it. 

This is a learning project, which started with a [backbone.js tutorial][3] which used localstorage.
I changed this to use a REST webservice and styled the html using [Twitter Bootstrap][4].
